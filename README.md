# NY-Yellow-taxi-trip-analysis-

The present research explores 2019 - December NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data for patterns that could make a significant difference in the community transportation strategies. Using data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, the study identifies areas without bus services where people are depending on taxis for travel and recommends introducing bus routes in those zones to enhance public transportation. We map hotspots of taxi trips against bus route coverage to identify key gaps in current transit systems. The insights to be gained from this study form the backbone of actionable recommendations through which the optimization of taxi dispatches and routes can not only be highly efficient themselves but also contribute towards better public transit accessibility that may help alleviate urban traffic congestion. The aim here is to further assist in consolidating the more integrated and sustainable pattern of urban mobility in New York City, aiming at much closer harmony among the independent taxi operators with the more general community transportation needs.

# Unique Analysis
General assumption was that people will prefer taxis when there are no available or frequent buses in that area. Figure xxxx represents the distribution of pickups of the taxi trips in New York City across various zones. Based on this analysis, except for JFK Airport, all the rest fall within Manhattan, showing the demand is high within this borough, reflecting its high population and economic activity within it. The analysis says that the zones are well-served by numerous bus routes. This further raised a question, passengers preferring taxi, is it because of the low fare or because of their income. 

From the analysis, the average fare amounts as displayed in the chart, reveal a fairly significant economic strain for these journeys. For example, there is a high average fare for Newark Airport which is one of the main destinations and which is an added cost for people traveling from no-bus zones. Fares are also high for breezy point/fort Tilden/Riis beach, City Island and Randalls Island which means these residents incur higher costs in making such travel which is essential for their welfare. This observation emphasizes a possible gap in the market for less expensive transit services for people reliant on taxis in bus-inaccessible areas or who have to pay additional distances to reach a bus stop.
Furthermore, the analysis will focus on the potential savings that could be achieved if bus services were available in zones that currently lack them. The estimated savings have been calculated by taking the average taxi fare in each no-bus zone, comparing it to the average bus fare in NYC, and finding the difference. This difference represents the potential savings per trip if residents used a bus instead of a taxi.

Newark Airport, being one of the main places where the residents from no-bus zones travel, offers a huge savings potential of close to $60,000 monthly. This suggests that if a bus service is provided to Newark Airport, residents would benefit greatly. Zones such as Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens and Red Hook have been cited as well having significant savings potential highlighting the exorbitant amount of taxi costs that residents have to pay for necessary commuting.
