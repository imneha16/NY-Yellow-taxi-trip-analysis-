# NY-Yellow-taxi-trip-analysis-

The present research explores 2019 - December NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data for patterns that could make a significant difference in the community transportation strategies. Using data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, the study identifies areas without bus services where people are depending on taxis for travel and recommends introducing bus routes in those zones to enhance public transportation. We map hotspots of taxi trips against bus route coverage to identify key gaps in current transit systems. The insights to be gained from this study form the backbone of actionable recommendations through which the optimization of taxi dispatches and routes can not only be highly efficient themselves but also contribute towards better public transit accessibility that may help alleviate urban traffic congestion. The aim here is to further assist in consolidating the more integrated and sustainable pattern of urban mobility in New York City, aiming at much closer harmony among the independent taxi operators with the more general community transportation needs.

# Unique Analysis
General assumption was that people will prefer taxis when there are no available or frequent buses in that area. Figure xxxx represents the distribution of pickups of the taxi trips in New York City across various zones. Based on this analysis, except for JFK Airport, all the rest fall within Manhattan, showing the demand is high within this borough, reflecting its high population and economic activity within it. The analysis says that the zones are well-served by numerous bus routes. This further raised a question, passengers preferring taxi, is it because of the low fare or because of their income. 

From the analysis, the average fare amounts as displayed in the chart, reveal a fairly significant economic strain for these journeys. For example, there is a high average fare for Newark Airport which is one of the main destinations and which is an added cost for people traveling from no-bus zones. Fares are also high for breezy point/fort Tilden/Riis beach, City Island and Randalls Island which means these residents incur higher costs in making such travel which is essential for their welfare. This observation emphasizes a possible gap in the market for less expensive transit services for people reliant on taxis in bus-inaccessible areas or who have to pay additional distances to reach a bus stop.
Furthermore, the analysis will focus on the potential savings that could be achieved if bus services were available in zones that currently lack them. The estimated savings have been calculated by taking the average taxi fare in each no-bus zone, comparing it to the average bus fare in NYC, and finding the difference. This difference represents the potential savings per trip if residents used a bus instead of a taxi.

Furthermore, the taxicab rides in regions with no bus services whereby residents use taxis thus causing an increased level of emissions has been addressed. Utilizing the national average emissions value of 404 grams of carbon dioxide per mile (US EPA), the distance covered by these taxis from these areas was computed, thus coming up with the CO2 emissions estimate. The results indicate that total of approximately 181.46 metric tons of CO2 emissions are projected in zones that do not have a network of buses. Adding bus routes in these areas which have been neglected for quite a long time would make a substantial difference in the amount of CO2 emissions and provide a better solution for public transport in the city of New York.

Newark Airport, being one of the main places where the residents from no-bus zones travel, offers a huge savings potential of close to $60,000 monthly. This suggests that if a bus service is provided to Newark Airport, residents would benefit greatly. Zones such as Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens and Red Hook have been cited as well having significant savings potential highlighting the exorbitant amount of taxi costs that residents have to pay for necessary commuting. 

# Commmunity Contribution
By optimizing bus routes and schedules, we promote sustainable transportation solutions that make a positive impact on the environment and on the community.
To offer a more refined bus route recommendation, we could suggest deploying a bus service to the most frequent drop-off location that people are availing taxis for from these no bus taxi-zones. And additionally, we should also analyze the corresponding pickup locations, by analyzing both the day of the week and the hour of the day. For instance, one such recommendation could be to deploy a bus from Times Square to Newark Airport on Sundays at 2:00 PM

# Conclusion
The analysis indeed establishes a link between the absence of bus services and high taxi use in the no bus area zones where residents are forced to pay a lot of money for taxi rides. The study adds that there is a need to introduce bus routes in these areas ,particularly at Newark Airport, to help reduce the transport costs. Moreover, the high CO2 emissions resulting from taxi trips in these areas also stress the benefits of having public transportation systems in place. The high CO2 emissions from taxi trips in these areas stress the needs for having public transportation systems in these areas. It is also possible to enhance transportation efficiency and increase the level of green traveling that would be beneficial for local people as well as the society at large by appealing to the bus services based on the demand. Indiscriminately allocating buses in relation to the amount of demand facilitates the efficiency of transit systems and promotes sustainable forms of urban mobility to the advantage not only of local residents but also of the community as a whole.
